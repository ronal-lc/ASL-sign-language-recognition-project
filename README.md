# ASL Alphabet Recognizer

## Purpose/Description

This project implements a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognizer using computer vision and machine learning. It captures hand gestures via a webcam, processes these gestures to extract key landmarks, and uses a trained neural network to classify them into corresponding ASL alphabet letters (A-Z).

Key features include:
*   **Image Collection:** A script to gather image data for each ASL letter (A-Z).
*   **Dataset Creation:** Processing of collected images to extract hand landmarks and create a structured dataset.
*   **Model Training:** Training a neural network for gesture classification.
*   **GUI Application:** A user-friendly interface for:
    *   Real-time ASL letter recognition (A-Z) using a webcam.
    *   A "Practice" mode to help users learn ASL letters by showing an image of a letter and verifying their attempt.
*   **Customizable UI:** Theme selection (Light/Dark).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Python scripts and data files:

*   `asl_alphabet.py`: The main GUI application built with PySide6 for real-time ASL recognition (A-Z) and the practice mode. Requires `icon.ico` to be present.
*   `collector_images.py`: Script for collecting image data for each ASL letter (A-Z).
*   `create_dataset.py`: Processes the images collected by `collector_images.py`. It uses MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks, performs data augmentation (flipping images), and saves the processed data into `data_signs.pickle`.
*   `data_classify.py`: Trains the neural network model using the `data_signs.pickle` dataset. The trained model is saved as `model.keras`.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
*   `data/`: Directory where images collected by `collector_images.py` are stored (organized into subdirectories for each letter A-Z). This directory is created automatically by `collector_images.py` if it doesn't exist.
*   `alphabet_examples/`: Contains example images (e.g., A.png, B.jpg) used in the "Practice" tab of the GUI application.
*   `model.keras`: The trained Keras neural network model file. Generated by `data_classify.py`. This file is crucial for the recognition functionality of `asl_alphabet.py`.
*   `data_signs.pickle`: The processed dataset containing hand landmarks and corresponding labels. Generated by `create_dataset.py` and used by `data_classify.py`.
*   `icon.ico`: The application icon used by `asl_alphabet.py`.
*   `down_arrow.png`, `down_arrow_dark.png`: Icons used for QComboBox dropdowns in different themes in `asl_alphabet.py`.
*   `reset.png`: Icon used for the reset button in `asl_alphabet.py`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronal-lc/ASL-sign-language-recognition-project.git
    cd ASL-sign-language-recognition-project
    ```
    (Note: The directory name might vary based on where you cloned it from.)

2.  **Set up a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. Then, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PySide6, and NumPy.

## Usage

Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer before running the recognition application. The necessary icon files (`icon.ico`, `down_arrow.png`, `down_arrow_dark.png`, `reset.png`) and the `model.keras` file should be in the same directory as the scripts, and example images should be in `alphabet_examples/`.

### 1. Data Collection (Optional)
This step is necessary if you want to train the model on your own hand gestures or expand the dataset.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python collector_images.py
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Follow the on-screen prompts. You will be asked to capture a set number of images for each ASL letter from A to Z. Images will be saved in the `data/` directory, organized into subfolders for each letter.

### 2. Dataset Creation (Optional)
After collecting images, process them to create the landmark dataset. This is needed if you performed Step 1.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python create_dataset.py
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This script reads images from the `data/` directory, uses MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks, performs data augmentation, and saves the processed landmarks and labels into `data_signs.pickle`.

### 3. Model Training (Optional)
Train the neural network model using the generated dataset. This is needed if you performed Step 2.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python data_classify.py
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This script loads data from `data_signs.pickle`, splits it, defines and compiles a Keras neural network, trains it, and saves the trained model as `model.keras`.

### 4. Running the GUI Application
To use the real-time ASL recognition and practice features. A pre-trained `model.keras` should be available.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python asl_alphabet.py
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This launches the main PySide6 GUI application.
    *   **Recognition Tab:** Provides a live webcam feed where you can make ASL hand signs (A-Z). The recognized letter will be displayed.
    *   **Practice Tab:** Allows you to select or be shown an ASL letter image. You can then try to replicate the sign, and the application will attempt to recognize your gesture.
    *   **Settings:** Theme (Light/Dark) can be adjusted from the settings panel at the bottom. Preferences are saved and loaded.

## Version Compatibility
This application relies on several libraries such as PySide6, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV. Compatibility issues between different versions of these libraries can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

During development and testing, the following versions were noted:
*   PySide6: 6.5.0
*   TensorFlow: 2.16.1
*   MediaPipe: 0.10.21 (or newer, e.g., 0.10.11)
*   OpenCV (cv2): 4.9.0.80

If you encounter persistent issues, especially related to startup, crashes, or unexpected errors after applying other troubleshooting steps, please consider:
*   Checking the official documentation for these libraries for known incompatibilities.
*   Creating a dedicated Python environment (e.g., using venv or conda).
*   Trying to align your installed versions with the ones listed above or other known stable combinations.
